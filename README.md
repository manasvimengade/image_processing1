Image processing is the field of study and application that deals with modifying and analyzing digital images using computer algorithms. The goal of image processing is to enhance the visual quality of images, extract useful information, and make images suitable for further analysis or interpretation.
EXP 1A = IMAGE RESIZONG
Scaling operations increase or reduce the size of an image. 
EXP 1B = Image Rotation
Images can be rotated to any degree clockwise or otherwise. We just need to define rotation matrix listing rotation point, degree of rotation and the scaling factor. 
EXP 1C = Image Translation
Translating an image means shifting it within a given frame of reference that can be along the x-axis and y-axis.
