# image_processing1
Image processing is the field of study and application that deals with modifying and analyzing digital images using computer algorithms. The goal of image processing is to enhance the visual quality of images, extract useful information, and make images suitable for further analysis or interpretation.
EXP 1A = IMAGE RESIZONG
Scaling operations increase or reduce the size of an image. 
EXP 1B = Image Rotation
Images can be rotated to any degree clockwise or otherwise. We just need to define rotation matrix listing rotation point, degree of rotation and the scaling factor. 
EXP 1C = Image Translation
Translating an image means shifting it within a given frame of reference that can be along the x-axis and y-axis.
EXP 1D = Image Normalization
Image normalization is a process of scaling the pixel values in an image to a specific range.This is often done to improve the performance of image processing algorithms, as many algorithms work better when the pixel values are within a certain range.
EXP 1E = Edge detection of Image
The process of image edge detection involves detecting sharp edges in the image. This edge detection is essential in the context of image recognition or object localization/detection. There are several algorithms for detecting edges due to its wide applicability.
EXP 1G = Image Blurring
Image blurring is the technique of reducing the detail of an image by averaging the pixel values in the neighborhood. This can be done to reduce noise, soften edges, or make it harder to identify a picture. In many image processing tasks, image blurring is a common preprocessing step. It is useful in the optimization of algorithms such as image classification, object identification, and image segmentation. In OpenCV, a variety of different blurring methods are available, each with a particular trade-off between blurring strength and speed.
EXP 1H = Morphological Image Processing
Morphological image processing is a set of python image processing techniques based on the geometry of objects in an image. These procedures are commonly used to eliminate noise, separate objects, and detect edges in images.
Conclusion
OpenCVâ€˜s image processing offers a strong basis for a variety of jobs, but it may be improved even more by utilizing the convolutional capability of deep learning. Advanced convolutional neural networks are available in these deep learning frameworks, which can preprocess images more accurately and effectively.
